Far, far below the deepest delvings of the dwarves, the world is gnawed by nameless things.
Speak, or I will put a dint in your hat that even a wizard will find hard to deal with!
I shall claim full amends for every fall and stubbed toe, if you do not lead us well.

.. But if all the fair folk take to the Havens, it will be a duller world for those who are doomed to stay.
Torment in the dark was the danger that I feared, and it did not hold me back. But I would not have come, had I known the danger of light and joy. Now I have taken my worst wound in this parting.
